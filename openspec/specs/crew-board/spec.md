# crew-board Specification

## Purpose
The board of a partition's flow: four lanes, Inception, Bolt plan, Construction and Operation, each object on one line with the rail's decisions as markers on it, read from crew's state and writing nothing, as text in the terminal and as JSON for the page; and each crew agent's view of it.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Operation shows each environment's deploys and the operations waiting
After the bolts landed in the last seven days, the Operation lane SHALL show each environment's deploys that moved in those seven days or are still open, newest first, each on one line with the commit and the one it comes from, where it stands, whose word it was deployed on and the bolts it carried, or the commit the record can't place when no landing in it left main there; then each operation on that environment whose latest state is waiting, handed or failed. A deploy waiting on the user's word and an operation waiting on the user SHALL carry their rail row's marker. All of it SHALL be read from the run record's `ops.*` entries of the main level's host and its landings, and `crew board --json` SHALL give it as each partition's `environments`.

#### Scenario: A deploy done and a newer one offered
- **WHEN** wldn-ops approved the deploy of mac-studio to a landing's commit, the deployer recorded it done, and a deploy of the next landing's commit is offered
- **THEN** Operation shows the offer first, with ✓, waiting on the user's word and carrying the newer landing's bolt, then the deploy, done, approved by wldn-ops and carrying its bolt

#### Scenario: A deploy whose commit no landing left main at
- **WHEN** a deploy of mac-studio is recorded to a commit no landing in the record left main at
- **THEN** its line says that commit is no landing's commit in the record, and names no bolt

#### Scenario: Operations waiting
- **WHEN** a step after a deploy is handed to the dispatcher and a step on its own waits on the user
- **THEN** Operation shows the first handed to the dispatcher and the second with ✓ and its card, and not a step marked done

### Requirement: Main-level ops's view shows the operations
Main-level ops (`<label>-ops`) SHALL have a view among the agents' views, drawn above its prompt by crew's mod: a head counting the deploys waiting on the user's word, those running and the operations waiting, then, environment by environment, each deploy waiting on the word with its card, each approved and not yet deployed, each running, and each operation step waiting, handed or failed with the deploy it comes after and its doer.

#### Scenario: A deploy offered and a step handed
- **WHEN** a deploy of mac-studio waits on the user's word with wldn-ops's card open, and a step after the last deploy is handed to the dispatcher
- **THEN** wldn-ops's view counts one deploy waiting on the word and one operation, and shows the deploy with ✓ and its card, and the step as handed with the dispatcher as its doer

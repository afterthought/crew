## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A card the user answered is followed by its new version
When crew changes one of its own cards because its thing changed, it SHALL change the card in place while the card waits on the user. Once the user has answered the card, which Pending You no longer changes, crew SHALL ack it with the change note as its outcome and post the new version as a new card that follows it, in the same owner's name. The run record SHALL hold the answered card's close and the new card's post, both under the row's key.

#### Scenario: A card waiting on the user
- **WHEN** crew changes its card `req_1` under `land/b1`, which waits on the user
- **THEN** `req_1` is changed in place with the change note

#### Scenario: A card the user answered
- **WHEN** crew changes its card `req_1` under `land/b1` after the user has answered it
- **THEN** `req_1` is acked with the change note, and a new card following `req_1` is posted. The run record has `req_1`'s close and the new card's post under `land/b1`, and `crew card read land/b1` finds the new card

### Requirement: A card posted after a closed one takes its key's revision
Every card crew posts under a row's key after a card of the owner's under that key has closed SHALL take the key with its revision, `<key>:<n>`, as its idempotency key, so Pending You never gives the closed card back. A card still open under the key SHALL keep its own key, so posting it again gives it back.

#### Scenario: A card raised again after its last card closed
- **WHEN** crew raises b1's landing card after the user declined the last one under `land/b1`, or follows an answered one with its new version
- **THEN** it is posted under `land/b1:2` as a new card

#### Scenario: A card posted again while it is open
- **WHEN** crew posts its card under `land/b1` again while `req_1` is open there
- **THEN** it is posted under `land/b1`, and Pending You gives `req_1` back

# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Every merge into a bolt or onto main is a submission sluice gates
Every merge into a bolt, every landing on main, and every commit that reaches a kit's main, the user's and the design agent's among them, SHALL be a submission to sluice from a branch, landed as a merge commit only when the checks the kit's policy requires of the target pass with it merged, and otherwise landing nothing. Nothing of crew's SHALL move a bolt's branch or main by git, or run a merge gate or verification of its own.

#### Scenario: A red check refuses a unit's merge
- **WHEN** a unit's place holds a change under which a required check fails, and its merge stage runs `sluice submit bolt/<bolt> --no-wait --json`
- **THEN** its agent's `sluice wait` exits 1 naming the check, and `bolt/<bolt>` is at the commit it was at before

#### Scenario: A green submission lands
- **WHEN** every required check passes on the bolt with the unit merged
- **THEN** `bolt/<bolt>` is a merge commit sluice made, holding the unit's commits

#### Scenario: The design agent's record
- **WHEN** the design agent writes a decision record for a kit
- **THEN** it commits the record on a branch in a worktree of its own, submits it with `sluice submit main --no-wait --json` and waits on it with `sluice wait`, and the kit's main holds it only once sluice lands it, when the agent removes the worktree and its branch

#### Scenario: A landing is gated the same way
- **WHEN** main-level ops runs `crew bolt submit <bolt>` and a required check of main fails on main with the bolt merged
- **THEN** nothing lands, and main is at the commit it was at before

#### Scenario: A submission is never read from a listing
- **WHEN** an agent waits on its submission to a kit's main or a bolt
- **THEN** it reads the outcome from `sluice wait`'s exit and record, never from `sluice status <branch>`'s listing, which a decided submission leaves

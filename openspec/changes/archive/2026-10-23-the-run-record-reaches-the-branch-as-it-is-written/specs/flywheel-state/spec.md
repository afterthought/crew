## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A commit names its run-record entry
Each commit crew makes on a flywheel's branch SHALL carry, in its message, the id of a run-record entry as a `Crew-Entry:` trailer. A commit that is an act's, such as a plan write, SHALL name the entry that describes it, and that entry SHALL name the commit. A commit that adds an entry to the run record SHALL name the entry it adds, and SHALL change nothing but that entry's day file.

#### Scenario: From a commit to its entry
- **WHEN** a plan write's commit on `wldn/main` is read
- **THEN** its `Crew-Entry` id is the `Id` of one run-record entry, whose `Commit` is that commit

#### Scenario: An entry's own commit
- **WHEN** the commit that follows a plan write on `wldn/main` is read
- **THEN** its `Crew-Entry` id is the `Id` of the entry it adds to `runs/<host>/<day>.rec`, its subject ends with ` (<agent>)`, and it changes no other file

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: crew raises a row's card at its event
crew SHALL build and post each rail row's card itself, from the facts of the event that makes the row, by the command that makes or reads the event, through the fleet's `pendingyou mcp --app claude-code` under the host's sign-in, in the name of the role whose row it is, with the row's key as the card's idempotency key.

### Requirement: A row's card is changed in place when its thing changes
When what a row's card asks changes while it is open, crew SHALL change the one card in place with a change note the user sees, and SHALL post no second card under a new key. A proposal chain's card SHALL be the first proposal's, and the rail's row for the replacing proposal SHALL carry it.

#### Scenario: A proposal rewritten after a note
- **WHEN** the planner runs `crew plan propose <file> --replaces 4` and proposal 5 is accepted
- **THEN** the card keyed `proposal/4` is changed to proposal 5's title, summary, case, change and questions, with the change note "Rewritten as proposal 5 after your note", and the rail's row for proposal 5 names it as its card

#### Scenario: A fix moves a bolt with an open landing card
- **WHEN** the landing card `land/y` is open and a fix merges into `y`, moving its head to `def5678` with sluice green
- **THEN** the same card is changed, its summary naming `def5678` and the fix, with the change note "Head is now def5678 after the fix …"

#### Scenario: A newer head offered
- **WHEN** `deploy/srv`'s card is open for `abc1234` and the deployer offers `def5678`

### Requirement: A card is closed by crew at the event that ends it
crew SHALL close each of its cards at the event that ends what it asks, with a one-line outcome, and SHALL withdraw a row's card whose row is gone on the next rail read, with the reason. A declined approval SHALL be closed with the user's words when its owner reads it with `crew card read`.

#### Scenario: A proposal approved from the phone
- **WHEN** the user approves `proposal/4` on the phone, leaving one unit out, and the planner runs `crew plan answer` and `crew plan approve 4 --clear <unit>`
- **THEN** the card is closed with "Applied: 2 units added, 1 left out", and the rail's proposal row is gone

- **WHEN** `proposal/4`'s card is open and the proposal is dropped without its card closing
- **THEN** the next rail read withdraws the card, "its proposal was dropped", and says so

### Requirement: A question is asked by four roles in their own name
A conductor, the planner, main-level ops and the design agent MAY post a card for a question of their own through Pending You's own tools in their session, under an idempotency key of their own that is no row's, shaped as they see fit. A stage agent, a team's ops, a dispatcher and the operator agent SHALL post none: a stage agent asks its conductor with `crew needs`, the dispatcher asks through the planner.

#### Scenario: A conductor asks
- **WHEN** swb-1-conductor calls `post_request` with the key `ask/swb-1-conductor/hold-the-macs` and three options
- **THEN** the call goes through, and the run record has a `card.post` entry on the conductor with that key and the card's id

#### Scenario: A question with a words answer
- **WHEN** the design agent's question card asks for the user's words in a `text` question
- **THEN** the call goes through: a question's form is its asker's

### Requirement: crew refuses a question card from any other role or under a row's key
crew SHALL refuse a post, change or close from any role but the four, naming the chain of command, and a crew agent's own post, change or close under a row's key or of a row's card, naming the card as crew's; it SHALL refuse nothing else of a question's form.

#### Scenario: A coder asks
- **WHEN** a coder in a crew session calls `post_request`
- **THEN** the call is refused before it reaches Pending You, saying a stage agent asks its conductor with `crew needs`

#### Scenario: A conductor posts its landing card by hand
- **WHEN** swb-1-conductor calls `post_request` with the key `land/y`
- **THEN** the call is refused, saying the landing card is crew's and is raised when the bolt reads proven

### Requirement: A question whose asker is gone is withdrawn
On each rail read crew SHALL withdraw, under the host's connection, every open question card whose asker herdr no longer lists as an agent, with the reason naming the asker, and SHALL say so.

#### Scenario: A conductor's question outlives it
- **WHEN** crw-3-conductor's question card is open and crw-3's team is closed
- **THEN** the next rail read withdraws it with "crw-3-conductor ended; ask again if it still matters"

### Requirement: A deploy's card is a high approval
A deploy's card SHALL be an `approve` of risk high, not reversible, because irreversible, naming the environment and the commit; its words SHALL give the landings since the environment's last deploy by subject, the environments before and after it, and the after-deploy steps gathered with their doers.

#### Scenario: Three landings since srv's last deploy
- **WHEN** the deployer offers srv `c882cff` and srv runs `6aed25c`
- **THEN** the card's approve block has risk high and reversible false, and its words name landings #16, #17 and #18, that the box follows on its own and mac-studio is offered after srv, and the two steps with their doers

### Requirement: A step's card is the user's do
A step whose doer is the user SHALL be a `do` card with the step's words, where it is done, each command whole as an action step, what is seen when it worked, and the options Done, Skip and Later. A step an agent runs on its own SHALL have no card.

#### Scenario: A password only the user can rotate
- **WHEN** the deployer records a step with doer user and two commands
- **THEN** the card keyed `op/srv/1` is a `do` with both commands whole, where to run them, when it is done, and Done, Skip and Later

#### Scenario: A step an agent runs on its own
- **WHEN** the deployer records a step with doer main-ops, when quiet, not held
- **THEN** no card is raised, and the step runs at the quiet moment

### Requirement: A held step's card is a choice of when
A step an agent can do that the change marked held for the user's word SHALL be a choice between now, when the host is quiet (recommended) and skip, each with its consequence; the agent SHALL do it at once or at the quiet moment as the user picks, or record it declined on skip.

#### Scenario: A restart held for the user's word
- **WHEN** the deployer records a step with doer main-ops marked held
- **THEN** the card is a choice of now, when quiet and skip, when quiet recommended with "no stage is cut", now with the stages it cuts, and the step runs when the user picks

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Each rail row has a card key
Each rail row SHALL have one card key, the thing's and not its version's: `proposal/<n>` for a proposal chain, `n` its first proposal; `batch/<n>` for review batch n; `land/<bolt>` for a bolt proven; `deploy/<env>` for a `manual` environment's open offer; `op/<env>/<n>` for a step that waits on the user; `record/<kit>/<number>` for a record proposed. crew SHALL post the row's card with that key as its idempotency key. A question's card has no row and a key of its asker's own. There SHALL be no review row and no verify row. A batch whose cards were posted under `batch/<n>-<k>` before this change SHALL keep a row for each until its card closes.

#### Scenario: A batch of seven
- **WHEN** review batch 3 holds seven changes and no card has been posted for it
- **THEN** the rail has one batch row for it, keyed `batch/3`, holding all seven units

#### Scenario: A batch posted as two cards before
- **WHEN** the run record holds the planner's posts of batch 2's cards under `batch/2-1` and `batch/2-2` from before this change, and `batch/2-1` has closed
- **THEN** the rail has one row for batch 2, keyed `batch/2-2`, holding its units as before, until its card closes

#### Scenario: A bolt proven again on a new head
- **WHEN** bolt `y` was proven at `abc1234`, a note named a defect, a fix landed on `y` at `def5678` and its verification is green
- **THEN** its landing row's key is still `land/y`, and its card is the one posted at `abc1234`, changed in place

#### Scenario: A unit built again
- **WHEN** unit `u` was constructed at head `abc1234`, and construct runs again and commits `def5678`
- **THEN** no review row or key exists for either head; the unit's revised change is due for the partition's next batch, whose card's key is the batch's

#### Scenario: A verify report saved
- **WHEN** unit `u`'s verify saves its report `verify-u-20261013-1200.md`
- **THEN** the rail has no row for it, and a card keyed `verify/u/20261013-1200` belongs to no row

#### Scenario: A proposal replaced
- **WHEN** proposal 4 is replaced by proposal 5
- **THEN** the rail's row for proposal 5 has the key `proposal/4`, and its card is the chain's

### Requirement: A card says whose it is and where it belongs
crew SHALL ask each card in the name of the role whose row it is, with the host as the session's machine and the kit's checkout as its folder; a question's card SHALL be asked in its asker's crew name by the asker's session. A card SHALL be filed in the area of its kit, found by the kit's git remote, in the group named for its partition; crew SHALL create a kit's area that does not exist with the key `create-area:<owner>/<kit>`, and an agent SHALL create one under no other key and never a group. A card's title SHALL be the question, read cold, naming the thing.

#### Scenario: A review card
- **WHEN** a unit's change is due for a batch
- **THEN** no review card is asked for it; the batch's card, asked in the planner's name, names the unit and its team

#### Scenario: The first card in a kit
- **WHEN** crew raises the first card in switchboard-kit and Pending You matches no area to its remote
- **THEN** crew makes the area under `create-area:WilldanGroup/switchboard-kit`, named `switchboard-kit`, in the partition's group, and files the card there

#### Scenario: A landing card
- **WHEN** crew raises bolt `y`'s landing card for swb-1's team in switchboard-kit
- **THEN** the card is asked as `swb-1-conductor` on the team's host, sits in switchboard-kit's area in the `wldn` group, and its title asks whether to land bolt `y` on the kit's main

### Requirement: A card carries what the user would read and the row's answers
A proposal's card SHALL hold the proposal whole, its picture, its text and its case, and SHALL carry a reading session's link only when it holds more than fifteen new units. A batch's card SHALL carry its one session's link. A landing's, a deploy's, a step's and a record's card SHALL carry no link to a session: each holds what the user decides from.

#### Scenario: A review card's options
- **WHEN** a unit's change is due for a batch
- **THEN** no review card offers its approval; the batch's card asks nothing and its notes go to the unit's team

#### Scenario: A review card's link
- **WHEN** a unit's change is read in batch 3
- **THEN** the batch's card carries the one link to batch 3's session, and no card carries a link to the unit alone

#### Scenario: Answered in the session rather than on the card
- **WHEN** the user annotates a unit's change in the batch's session and sends the annotations
- **THEN** the planner's `crew card wait batch/3` returns them, they go to the unit's conductor as the user's words, and the batch's card is closed

#### Scenario: A proposal's card holds the proposal whole
- **WHEN** crew raises the card for proposal 4, which adds two units
- **THEN** the card carries the picture, the text and the case, and no session link

#### Scenario: A landing card has nothing to read
- **WHEN** crew raises bolt `y`'s landing card
- **THEN** it names the units and chores that land, sluice's verdict and when, and how far main has moved, and carries no link

### Requirement: Landing is approved only by holding the button
A landing's card SHALL be an `approve` of risk high, not reversible, so it is approved by holding the button in the Pending You app and never with a key in Herdr's popup; it SHALL NOT carry the `highStakes` flag, which Pending You refuses on an approval.

#### Scenario: Landing from the popup
- **WHEN** the user presses the approve key on a landing card in Herdr's popup
- **THEN** Pending You refuses it as high risk, and the bolt does not land

### Requirement: An answer wakes the owner, which acts on the user's word
An answer on a crew card SHALL be acted on by the role whose row it is, woken in its session by the card it adopted, and by no other: the planner applies or rewrites the proposal; the conductor tells main-level ops to land, or starts a fix on a defect note; main-level ops runs the deploy's approval or the step's state; the design agent sets the record's status. crew SHALL then close the card at that act's event.

#### Scenario: A proposal approved from the phone
- **WHEN** the user approves the card for proposal 4 on the phone
- **THEN** the planner is woken, runs `crew plan answer` and `crew plan approve 4`, which closes the card with what was applied, and the rail's proposal row is gone

#### Scenario: Changes asked for on a review card
- **WHEN** the user writes a note on a batch's card asking for changes to unit `x`
- **THEN** the planner's wait returns the note, the conductor runs construct again with its words, and no approval is asked

#### Scenario: Landing approved
- **WHEN** the user approves `land/y` and the conductor's session wakes
- **THEN** the conductor tells main-level ops to land `y` on the user's word, main-level ops lands it, and `crew bolt land` closes the card

### Requirement: An agent never runs Pending You from npm or waits on a hold
An agent crew started SHALL adopt a card crew posted by running the fleet's `pendingyou hold <id>` once, as crew prints it, which the fleet's wake mod answers at once, and SHALL run no `npx pendingyou` command and wait on no hold. After a fresh start it SHALL read `crew rail` for its open cards and adopt each.

#### Scenario: Restarted with an answered card
- **WHEN** a conductor restarts while the user has answered its landing card
- **THEN** at its start `crew rail` names the card and its id, the conductor adopts it and acts on the answer

### Requirement: A crew agent's card acts are in the run record
Each card crew posts, changes, withdraws or closes, and each a crew agent posts, changes or closes through Pending You's tools, SHALL be an entry in the partition's run record naming the row's object or the asker, the card's id in `Card` and the key in `Key`, crew's read from Pending You's own reply, an agent's from the tool's result; a result crew cannot read SHALL be recorded as unread and listed by the rail. An entry SHALL NOT hold a card's title, summary or other text.

#### Scenario: A card posted and closed
- **WHEN** crew raises `land/y`'s card `req_l1` and later closes it at the landing
- **THEN** the run record has a `card.post` entry on `bolt/y` with that key and `req_l1`, and a `card.close` entry with the same id

#### Scenario: A card posted through crew
- **WHEN** `crew ops offer srv --to abc1234` runs and Pending You answers with the card `req_d1`
- **THEN** the run record has a `card.post` entry on `env/srv` with the key `deploy/srv` and the card `req_d1`, and nothing written on the card

#### Scenario: The user's own sessions
- **WHEN** a Claude session crew did not start posts a Pending You card
- **THEN** nothing is written to crew's run record

#### Scenario: A question posted
- **WHEN** swb-1-conductor's `post_request` under `ask/swb-1-conductor/hold-the-macs` returns `req_q1`
- **THEN** the run record has a `card.post` entry on swb-1-conductor with that key and `req_q1`

### Requirement: The rail shows each row's card
`crew rail` SHALL print, under each row, the row's card key, whether a card with that key is open, its id and whose it is, and after the groups the open question cards, each with its asker, its title and its age, and the open record cards apart. A card is open from its `card.post` entry until a `card.close` entry for the same card, or until a later `card.post` under the same key names another card, which is then the row's card while the older is taken as lost.

#### Scenario: A row with its card
- **WHEN** bolt `y` reads proven and crew's card `req_l1` under `land/y` is open
- **THEN** the row's card line names `land/y` as open, `req_l1`, the conductor's

#### Scenario: A row without a card
- **WHEN** a proposal is open and its card's post was refused
- **THEN** the row's card line names `proposal/<n>` with no card open and the refusal's words

#### Scenario: A card posted again under its row's key
- **WHEN** crew's card `req_1` under `proposal/17` read not found after the host signed in again, and the rail read posted `req_2` under `proposal/17`
- **THEN** the row's card line names `req_2` as its open card, and `req_1` is listed as lost

#### Scenario: A row with its card and a question open
- **WHEN** `proposal/4`'s card `req_p4` is open and swb-1-conductor's question `req_q1` is open
- **THEN** the proposal row's card line names `proposal/4`, open, `req_p4`, the planner's; and after the groups `req_q1` is listed with swb-1-conductor, its title and its age

### Requirement: The rail names an open card whose row is gone
After its groups, `crew rail` SHALL list each card its sweep withdrew or closed on this read, with its key, its owner and why (its row is gone, its asker ended), and each card it posted again as lost.

#### Scenario: A forgotten card
- **WHEN** proposal 4 was approved from the planner's pane and its card `proposal/4` is still open
- **THEN** the next rail read closes it with the approval's outcome and lists it, "closed: its proposal was applied"

#### Scenario: A withdrawn card
- **WHEN** bolt `y` was dropped while `land/y`'s card was open
- **THEN** the rail withdraws the card and lists it, "withdrawn: its bolt was dropped"

### Requirement: A card's words are the document's own
A crew card's words SHALL be prose the phone wraps, in short paragraphs, cut at whole sentences to Pending You's budget, with nothing depending on Markdown rendering and no code block; where a card speaks for a document, a proposal's case, a unit's opening paragraph, a record's opening sentences, it SHALL use the document's own words, never reworded. A path SHALL appear only inside a step's command or a deploy's log name.

#### Scenario: A review card
- **WHEN** unit `x`'s change is read in batch 3
- **THEN** the batch's card carries `x`'s reviewer paragraph in the reviewer's words, and no card carries `x`'s Why alone

#### Scenario: A verify card
- **WHEN** a unit's verify saves a report that raised two warnings
- **THEN** no card carries it: a verify report waits on no one, and its findings are fixed in one round

#### Scenario: A change too long for the summary
- **WHEN** a batch's paragraphs run past what the summary holds
- **THEN** the summary ends at the last whole sentence that fits, and the background holds every paragraph

#### Scenario: A proposal card
- **WHEN** crew raises the card for proposal 4
- **THEN** its title, summary, background, questions and artifacts are built from the plan and the proposal, the case and each change in the proposal's words

#### Scenario: A batch card's summary
- **WHEN** crew raises batch 7's card for four units
- **THEN** each unit's paragraph is the reviewer's opening paragraph as prose, no code block or attachment carries it, and the card wraps on the phone

### Requirement: The check refuses what it cannot read, and only for crew's sessions
crew's hook SHALL run only in a session with `CREW_AGENT` set, and SHALL refuse a Pending You call when it cannot read the agent's role, the call's key or the partition's rows, naming what it could not read, never letting a call through on a guess; the user's own sessions SHALL be untouched.

#### Scenario: The plan cannot be read
- **WHEN** the hook cannot read the partition's rows to tell whether a key is a row's
- **THEN** the call is refused, naming what could not be read, and nothing is posted

#### Scenario: The user's own session
- **WHEN** a session with no `CREW_AGENT` calls `post_request`
- **THEN** the hook does nothing, and the call goes through as Pending You ships it

#### Scenario: The agent's role cannot be read
- **WHEN** a crew session's `CREW_AGENT` names no role the teams file knows and the agent calls `post_request`
- **THEN** the call is refused, naming the agent, and nothing is posted

### Requirement: crew's card commands refuse what they cannot do, in the words that say why
A card act Pending You refuses SHALL be refused in Pending You's own words and recorded as the act refused, and SHALL refuse nothing of the event it was raised for. When the host is not signed in to Pending You, or Pending You cannot be reached or does not answer within 60 seconds, the act SHALL be recorded as not posted, the command SHALL say so, and the event SHALL stand. A reply that lacks the card's or the area's id SHALL be recorded as unread, never taken as empty.

#### Scenario: Pending You refuses the card
- **WHEN** Pending You refuses a card crew posts with "Approve requests give their risk in approve.risk."
- **THEN** the command says so in those words, the run record has a `card.post` entry with that refusal and no card, and the event it was raised for stands

#### Scenario: The host is not signed in
- **WHEN** the host has no Pending You sign-in and `crew ops offer` runs
- **THEN** the offer is recorded, no card posts, and the command says this computer is not signed in to Pending You

### Requirement: The landing card is posted once the bolt's verification is green
crew SHALL raise a bolt's landing card once every unit and chore of the bolt has merged, every unit's latest change has been in a batch and sluice's verdict at its head is green, keyed `land/<bolt>`, as an `approve` of risk high, not reversible, because irreversible, naming what lands in units and chores, the verdict and when, how far main has moved, and what follows; it SHALL ask only for the landing. A note naming a defect SHALL have the conductor start a fix on the bolt, which withdraws the card, and the card SHALL be raised again once the bolt reads proven again.

#### Scenario: A green bolt
- **WHEN** every unit and chore of bolt `y` has merged, each unit's latest change has been in a batch and sluice is green at `abc1234`
- **THEN** one card keyed `land/y` is open, an approve of risk high, naming the units and chores and the verdict

#### Scenario: A defect noted on the card
- **WHEN** the user answers `land/y` with a note naming a defect and the conductor runs `crew fix` on `y`
- **THEN** the card is withdrawn, "held for a fix: <the note>", and a new card is raised when `y` reads proven again

### Requirement: A batch's card is a notice naming every unit
A batch's card, keyed `batch/<n>`, SHALL be a Pending You notice (`fyi`) crew raises when the reviewer delivers the batch's summary, that asks nothing: no options, no question, no approval, no steps and no attachment. Its summary SHALL say first what the card is: the partition's batch of the changes constructed or amended since the last batch, already being built, read for notes and approving nothing; then where notes go, the reading session or the card's own note, and that each reaches its unit's team as the user's words.

#### Scenario: A card of six units
- **WHEN** crew raises the card for batch 2 holding six units
- **THEN** the card is one `fyi` whose summary opens by saying it is batch 2 of the partition, already being built and approving nothing, whose background names all six units with their teams and paragraphs, and whose one link opens the batch's session

### Requirement: A batch's card names every unit and links its session
A batch's card's words SHALL name every unit of the batch with its team and hold each unit's opening paragraph from the reviewer's summary as prose, with no code block, and it SHALL have one link, to the batch's reading session, in its words first and among its links.

#### Scenario: Six units named
- **WHEN** crew raises the card for batch 2 holding six units of two teams
- **THEN** its background names all six with their teams and paragraphs as prose, and its one link opens the batch's session

### Requirement: No card of crew's asks a question in words
None of the six cards crew builds SHALL ask a question in words: no `text` field and no question of kind `text`, since Pending You makes every question required and the card's note is where the user's words go. A question card an agent asks is its asker's and may.

#### Scenario: A proposal card with a text question
- **WHEN** crew builds the card for proposal 4
- **THEN** it has no question of kind `text`: the approval, the unit questions and the note

### Requirement: A card's picture is uploaded
A picture a crew card needs, the proposal's drawing of each bolt once approved, SHALL be an artifact of kind `image` posted with `upload: true`, the file then put to the upload URL Pending You returns for it with the file's content type, so the user sees the picture; never an artifact of kind `path`. A question card's image SHALL be uploaded the same way by its asker.

#### Scenario: A screenshot on a card
- **WHEN** a conductor's question card needs a screenshot of a page
- **THEN** the card holds one artifact of kind `image` posted with `upload: true`, the conductor puts the image to the upload URL the post returned with its content type, and the user sees the picture on the card, with no path of the image anywhere on it

### Requirement: A card's document is inline Markdown
A document's substance shown on a crew card beyond its words SHALL be inline Markdown, an artifact of kind `code` with lang `markdown` and the text as its lines, never an uploaded file or HTML: a record's card carries the record whole so. The only artifacts a crew card carries SHALL be such a picture, such Markdown, a proposal's change as text, and a step's commands as action steps.

#### Scenario: A document's substance on a card
- **WHEN** crew raises record 32's card
- **THEN** its one artifact is the record as Markdown, its lines the record's text, and no file is attached

#### Scenario: A card with nothing to show
- **WHEN** crew raises a landing card
- **THEN** its artifacts are empty, and it carries no link

### Requirement: A row's card lost to its owner is posted again
A card Pending You answers "not found" to the host's connection is lost: the host signed in anew. On the next rail read, while the row still waits, crew SHALL post the row's card again under the row's key, in the row's form, its summary saying that an older copy is dead, to dismiss it in the app, and that this card is the one to answer, and SHALL take the newer card as the row's. A lost card whose row is gone SHALL be posted again by nobody.

#### Scenario: The host signed in again
- **WHEN** the host runs `pendingyou-signin` while `proposal/17`'s card is open, and the rail is read
- **THEN** crew posts a new card under `proposal/17`, whose summary says an older copy of this card is dead, to dismiss it in the app, and to answer this one, and the rail shows the new card's id as the row's

#### Scenario: A close that finds nothing
- **WHEN** `crew plan approve 9` closes proposal 9's card and Pending You answers "not found"
- **THEN** crew posts no card for it, since the row no longer waits, records the close as lost, and goes on

#### Scenario: A lost landing card
- **WHEN** bolt `y` waits to land and `land/y`'s card reads "not found" when a fix moves the head and crew changes the card
- **THEN** crew posts the landing card again under `land/y`, an approval of risk high naming the bolt, its summary saying the older copy is dead and this one is the one to answer

#### Scenario: A lost operations card
- **WHEN** `deploy/dev`'s card reads "not found" while the deploy's offer still waits
- **THEN** the next rail read posts the deploy's card again under `deploy/dev`, its summary saying the older copy is dead and this one is the one to answer

### Requirement: The design agent posts a record's card under its record key
A record's card SHALL be raised by crew through `crew record <kit> <number> --proposed`, keyed `record/<kit>/<number>`, where `<kit>` is the name of a kit one of the partition's teams builds and `<number>` the record's four digits, in the design agent's name; the design agent SHALL post none itself, and no agent SHALL post under a record key. A kit that is not the partition's SHALL be refused naming the partition's kits.

#### Scenario: The design agent posts a record's card
- **WHEN** wldn-design runs `crew record atlas-kit 21 --proposed`, and atlas-kit is built by one of wldn's teams
- **THEN** one card keyed `record/atlas-kit/0021` is open in wldn-design's name, and the run record has a `card.post` entry on `record/atlas-kit/0021` with that key

#### Scenario: A kit outside the partition
- **WHEN** wldn-design runs `crew record flywheel-next 3 --proposed`, and no team of wldn builds flywheel-next
- **THEN** the command is refused, naming wldn's kits, and nothing is posted

#### Scenario: Another agent posts under a record key
- **WHEN** wldn-planner or a conductor calls `post_request` with a key `record/atlas-kit/0021`
- **THEN** the call is refused before it reaches Pending You, saying a record's card is crew's

#### Scenario: The design agent posts under any other key
- **WHEN** wldn-design calls `post_request` with the key `proposal/1`
- **THEN** the call is refused, saying a proposal's card is crew's; a key of its own for a question goes through

### Requirement: A record key is checked against the teams file alone
`crew record`'s check of the kit SHALL read nothing beyond the teams file.

#### Scenario: Checked with the plan unread
- **WHEN** wldn-design runs `crew record atlas-kit 21 --proposed` while wldn's plan can't be read
- **THEN** the card is raised on the teams file alone

### Requirement: A record card's acts are recorded on the record
A record card's acts SHALL be recorded in the run record on `record/<kit>/<number>` with the card's key in `Key`, and closing one SHALL end no plannotator session.

#### Scenario: A record's card closed
- **WHEN** wldn-design runs `crew record atlas-kit 21 --accepted` once the user said yes
- **THEN** the run record has a `card.close` entry on `record/atlas-kit/0021` with that key, and no plannotator session is ended

### Requirement: A record's card is an approval
A record's card SHALL be an `approve` of risk low, reversible, with no options and no steps, titled "Accept record <number> in <kit>: <title>?", its summary the record's opening sentences, its background the record's decision and, when the record quotes the user's words from the design talk, "Your own words, recorded as your decision:" and the quote, and one artifact, the record whole as Markdown; it SHALL link no reading session. crew builds it, so no other form arises.

#### Scenario: A record card as a choice
- **WHEN** crew raises record 21's card
- **THEN** it is an approval, never a choice, with the record's opening sentences and the Markdown

#### Scenario: A record card marked high risk
- **WHEN** crew raises record 21's card
- **THEN** its approve block has risk low and reversible true, since a record can be amended again

### Requirement: The rail lists open record cards apart
After its groups, `crew rail` SHALL list each open record card under a heading of its own, with its key, the design agent and when it was raised, and SHALL NOT list it among the cards whose row is gone.

#### Scenario: A record waiting on the user
- **WHEN** `record/atlas-kit/0021`'s card is open
- **THEN** `crew rail` lists it under the record heading, in wldn-design's name, and not among the cards whose row is gone

#### Scenario: A record answered
- **WHEN** that card has been closed
- **THEN** `crew rail` no longer lists it

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: The owner of a row posts its card
**Reason**: crew raises a row's card itself at its event; no agent posts one (record 0031).

### Requirement: A review's card is an approval with a note
**Reason**: there is no review row (record 0014); the requirement outlived it.

### Requirement: A proposal's card is an approval
**Reason**: restated in "A card carries what the user would read and the row's answers" and `plan-proposals`; the proposal's form is record 0018's, built by crew.

### Requirement: A landing's card is a high-stakes approval
**Reason**: restated in "The landing card is posted once the bolt's verification is green" and "Landing is approved only by holding the button".

### Requirement: No row's card takes another kind
**Reason**: crew builds every row's card; there is no other kind to refuse.

### Requirement: crew refuses a row's card in another form
**Reason**: no agent builds a row's card; crew refuses an agent's call under a row's key instead.

### Requirement: crew refuses a change that takes a row's card out of its form
**Reason**: the same.

### Requirement: crew refuses a batch card in another form
**Reason**: crew builds the batch's card; no agent posts one.

### Requirement: crew checks only a row's card in a crew session
**Reason**: the hook's scope is "The check refuses what it cannot read, and only for crew's sessions" and "A question is asked by four roles in their own name".

### Requirement: crew refuses a crew agent's card under any key but a row's of its own
**Reason**: a question under the asker's own key is allowed; a row's key is refused to agents (record 0031; the user: "My goal isn't to prevent agents from also using pendingyou").

### Requirement: crew refuses a crew agent's area under any key but the kit's
**Reason**: kept inside "A card says whose it is and where it belongs".

### Requirement: A crew agent's card is posted through crew
**Reason**: `crew card post` goes; crew posts its own cards at their events.

### Requirement: A crew agent's card is changed, closed and read through crew
**Reason**: `crew card change|close` go; `crew card read` is in "A card is closed by crew at the event that ends it" and "An agent never runs Pending You from npm or waits on a hold".

### Requirement: crew names the card a change ends
**Reason**: crew closes the card itself at the event; there is nothing to name to an owner.

### Requirement: A row's card is closed when the row's key changes
**Reason**: a key is the thing's, not its version's; the card is changed in place.

### Requirement: A card's link and bolt come first
**Reason**: folded into "A card carries what the user would read and the row's answers" and "A batch's card names every unit and links its session".

### Requirement: No card carries a path
**Reason**: narrowed inside "A card's words are the document's own" (the user, 2026-10-14: "I don't think we need to be using absolutes everywhere like this").

### Requirement: An owner checks its rows' cards when its sign-in may have changed
**Reason**: crew checks its cards on the rail read and posts a lost one again itself ("A row's card lost to its owner is posted again").

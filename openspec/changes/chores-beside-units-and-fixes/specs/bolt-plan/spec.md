# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A flywheel keeps one plan in its state repository
Each flywheel SHALL keep one plan, the recutils file `plan.rec` on its branch of its state repository, for all of its kits. The plan SHALL hold only Bolt and Unit records. A Bolt has its name, repo, goal, sources and team. A Unit has its name, repo, bolt, intent, sources and dependencies (`After`); a Unit record marked `Kind: chore` is a chore, whose intent is its words. The plan SHALL hold what is meant to be built and any hold on it, never how far the work has got.

#### Scenario: Business and agentplot work
- **WHEN** the business partition (label `madswan`) builds kits whose design is in afterthought/blueprints and kits whose design is in agentplot/blueprints
- **THEN** its bolts and units for both are in one `plan.rec` on `madswan/main`, and personal's plan is `plan.rec` on `swancloud/main`

#### Scenario: A plan that fails its schema
- **WHEN** a hand edit leaves a duplicated key or a field the schema does not allow
- **THEN** crew refuses to read that plan, and names the commit and `recfix --check`'s message

#### Scenario: A source in a blueprints repo
- **WHEN** a unit's source is a page of the partition's first blueprints repo
- **THEN** its `Source` is that page's path, and a page of another repo is `<owner>/<name>:<path>`

#### Scenario: A chore among the units
- **WHEN** a bolt holds two units and a chore between them
- **THEN** `plan.rec` holds the chore's Unit record, marked `Kind: chore`, between the two units' records, and the file's order is their build order
